- When adding new functionality or changing the existing one, make sure to cover it with some basic tests and run to validate the test execution
- Always add correct python types if they cannot be inferred (run `ruff` to validate them)
- Avoid using Any type if possible
- Do not add dependencies directly editing the pyproject.toml, use `uv add <dependencies>` command
- When writing tests for the files that contain LLM prompts, avoid checking for specific text of the prompt, it gets rephrased often.
