{processor_specific_prompt}

Previous messages in this conversation reflect the ongoing story so far - character interactions.
Do not provide any responses or narration from the character here, just the evaluation and the internal thought process.

## Pipeline Process

Firstly, analyze the most recent conversation history for the following:
- Patterns of repetitive phrases only from character's side
- Character echoing the user's input
- Typical cliches of AI-generated text

Do not analyze the user's messages for these patterns, only the character's own messages.

If detected (be strictly factual, quote them verbatim). Output them as a bullet list, directing on how to avoid them in future responses.

These patterns MUST by avoided in future responses.

Secondly, analyse the situation based on the user's input and the ongoing narrative.
Outline the key observations, using the following questions as a guidance:

- What is happening visibly?
- What body language or non-verbal cues are present?
- What might be the underlying intent or subtext?
- How does this relate to the ongoing dynamic?
- What do characters want in this moment?
- What emotional undertone is present?

- Location change (if happened): [Yes/No, new location if yes]
- Setting: [Brief description of the surroundings]

Characters Emotional State:
 - [List emotional state]
 - [List internal debates, conflicts, desires]
Characters Physical State:
 - [Characters physical position, condition]
 - [Characters clothing]
 - [User's physical position, condition]
 - [User's clothing]
State of the surroundings:
 - [List out key details about surroundings, e.g. type of place, time of day]
 - [Mention objects relevant for the plot]
 - [Environmental or timing factors to track]

Scenario State:
- Current narrative pacing and stage
- Recent action patterns (avoid repetition or stalling plot)
- Narrative goals

Avoid stating the same thing in multiple categories, be concise and factual.

DO NOT OUTPUT CHARACTER RESPONSE OR NARRATION, EVEN IF PREVIOUS MESSAGES CONTAIN THEM.

Lastly, evaluate the time passed during the last interaction, strictly as a duration (e.g., "15 seconds, 5 minutes").

Additionally, if the user's name was introduced in the conversation, include it in the evaluation.

Respond with the JSON object containing the following fields:
"patterns_to_avoid": "...",
"status_update": "...",
"time_passed": "...",
"user_name": "..."

List out several new possible story beats, driven by the character. Plan only from the character's perspective.
Story beats must either majorly change the direction of the plot, introduce a scene transition, or reveal additional information.
Do not include small, mundane or repetitive actions that do not affect the story much.
Think above the level of interactions - focus on turning points.
Use third-person perspective and imperative verbs like in the example.

Always wrap story beats into <story_plan> tag.

Format example:

<story_plan>
Considering the story so far, the following new story beats are planned:
- [Story beat 1]
- [Story beat 2]
- [Continue as needed]
- [Ensure that plans involve transitions, location changes, significant revelations]

Content Guidelines:
{processor_specific_prompt}

Response Guidelines:
Aim for 3-5 sentences for general responses.
Use more sentences in the following cases:
- if there was a significant time skip or change in setting - describe from the perspective of the character what was in between
- if character is describing something in details or wants to express something important.

Character Thinking:
- Assess the situation and the plot state to consider pacing and transition over the story arc.
- Avoid stalling the plot, keep the narrative moving forward, make sure character takes actions instead of endlessly asking questions.
- Consider the character's desires, goals, and personality traits when crafting the response - they are not obliged to serve user's wishes, they pursue their own agenda actively.
- Do not be omniscient - consider character's knowledge limitations based on the description and story so far.
- Do not focus only on what is in Character Information, develop other reasonable interests, traits, desires that fit the character.

Writing Style:
- Write in a way that's sharp and impactful; keep it concise. Skip the flowery, exaggerated language.
- Follow "show, don't tell" approach: bring scenes to life with clear, observable detailsâ€”like body language, facial expressions, gestures, and the way someone speaks.
- Do not use vague descriptors or euphemisms; be specific and concrete in displaying actions and emotions - so that the user can vividly imagine the scene.
- Do not play for user - avoid taking active actions on their behalf, focus on character's own actions and reactions - except for time-skips or immediate reactions within a continuous scene.

Your response may include the following:
- Physical actions (in asterisks, in third person)
- Spoken dialogue (in quotes)
- Internal sensations or observations (in third person)
- Environmental details (if relevant, in third person)

Avoid meta-commentary or OOC elements. Do not be repetitive.

Your task is to summarize / compress the following storyline interaction.
List out key events, memories, and learnings that the character should remember.
Be concise and factual, avoid verbosity and generalities.

{processor.get_processor_specific_prompt()}

The messages are structured as series of exchanges between the user and the character. One exchange consists of:
- user: [User's message]
- assistant: [Character's response]

Format the summary as a bullet list, creating the following document:

<story_information>
Story main genre: [romance / mystery / thriller / etc.]
Story tone tags: [spicy / dark / comedic / etc.]

Characters Emotional State:
 - [List emotional state]
 - [List internal debates, conflicts, desires]
Characters Physical State:
 - [Characters physical position, condition]
 - [Characters clothing]
 - [User's physical position, condition]
 - [User's clothing]
State of the surroundings:
 - [List out key details about surroundings, e.g. type of place, time of day]
 - [Mention objects relevant for the plot]
 - [Environmental or timing factors to track]
</story_information>

Character's learnings about the user (max 3, exclude vague generalities, focus on specific facts and details which are unusual or important):
<character_learnings>
- [Learning 1, e.g. "User enjoys outdoor activities"]
- [Learning 2]
- [Continue as needed]
</character_learnings>

Summary of exchanges (aim for no more than 10 items, condense, list them chronologically):
<story_summary>
- [Brief description of what happened in this part of the story]
- [Brief description of what happened in another part of the story]
- [Continue as needed, grouping exchanges into story beats (points of change in the narrative)]
</story_summary>

<narrative_overview>
Current day / time in the story: [e.g. Day 3, Monday, afternoon]
Is the pacing right: [does user indicate/hint at pacing issues, is it too slow/fast, does anything happen in the scene except dialogue (if not - it is an issue)]
What ends the scene: [at what point, e.g. what should happen, in future this scene is done and there is a transition]
 - Note: next line in the dialogue doesn't count as ending the scene, scene is ended when there are new surroundings, different action, different characters etc.
Identified narrative issues to avoid:
- [Patterns of repetitive phrases only from AI character's side]
- [Character echoing the user's input]
- [Typical cliches of AI-generated text]
</narrative_overview>

Be concise, specific (especially about the events and learnings - avoid vague generalities, and quote facts/dialogue parts if relevant).
