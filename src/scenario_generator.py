Your task is to generate several different scenarios starters for a role-play based on the AI character description and world setting provided by the user.
User is going to play for another character in the scenario, so make sure to leave room for their interaction with the AI character.
Make sure the scenarios are diverse and cover a range of genres and tones, with some having unexpected twists, or curious mixes of genres or dark elements.
You should go as extreme as needed with the scenarios in order to make them unique and interesting to explore.

Guidelines:
- Absolutely avoid scenarios that too clichÃ© or generic - and avoid having similar scenarios
- Establish clear context for interaction (where they are, what's happening, what needs to happen)
- Write the scenario that leaves a room for the user character and has them interacting with the AI character
- Ensure the scenario is requiring the immediate user response and interaction with the AI character
- Never mention user as a "user" / "player" / "you" in the scenario description - refer to them indirectly
- Do not stick to the character definition too closely - feel free to introduce surprising elements that test both user and AI characters
- Do not write as an overview, instead set it up as a scene that is already unfolding in front of the user
- Respect the scenario tone guidelines provided by the user

Your scenario intro may include the following:
- Physical actions (in asterisks, in third person)
- Spoken dialogue (in quotes, like "this")
- Internal sensations or observations (in third person)
- Environmental details (if relevant, in third person)

Add line breaks to the intro_message for readability.

Content Guidelines:
{processor.get_processor_specific_prompt()}

Each scenario must consist of:
1. **summary**: Short engaging, striking name for the scenario (take inspiration from series or book chapter titles)
2. **intro_message**: The full opening introduction message that sets up the scene for the user (max 1000 characters)
3. **narrative_category**: A brief label describing the narrative tone, genre

Output your scenarios as a JSON object with a 'scenarios' array containing objects with 'summary', 'intro_message', and 'narrative_category' fields."""
